## Description

This is the first iteration of a personal website that will used to showcase my skills as a web developer and, in it's current state, consists of three pages: an About Me page, a Contact page, and a Portfolio page.

Many elements within these pages are sitting as fun, lighthearted placeholders as the critical goal is to create a well made framework for this website. As a result, the current iteration of this project is styled in the theme of Batman and his numerous incarnations.
